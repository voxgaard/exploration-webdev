    <h1>Circa 2006</h1>

    <p>No contract was made, even verbally;</p>
    <p>This debt materialized over time &#8212;</p>
    <p>Forged organically, tempered subconsciously, contoured unfortunately.</p>
    <p>Even were you geographically near,</p>
    <p>I cannot intervene - the past has cemented my failure.</p>
    <p>I attempt to show others the compassion I owed dearly to you,</p>
    <p>Trying to restore a shred of faith in myself.</p>
    <p>For all I know you're alive and well...</p>
    <p>I'm terrified that you're not.</p>
    <p>What plagues me now has assured me,</p>
    <p>I didn't see your rage.</p>
